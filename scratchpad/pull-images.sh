#
# Default dest: /mnt/games/images/runpod/MM-DD-YYYY/ — today's date, because a pod's images are a
# day's work and that is how they are looked for later.
#
# A pod's disk does not survive termination, and nothing on it is backed up anywhere. This is the
# last chance. Run it BEFORE `podTerminate`, every time, no exceptions.
#
# Two sources, because neither is complete on its own:
#   /history                 every prompt this ComfyUI has run, with the images each produced.
#                            The app saves through PreviewImage, so these live in temp/ and
#                            ComfyUI wipes temp/ on its next start — they are gone after a resume.
#   /imagelab/favorites      anything explicitly starred, copied out of temp/ into a dated tree by
#                            ImageLabCore. These survive a restart but not a terminate.
